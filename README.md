# Generative AI Discord Bot
The Generative AI Discord bot utilizes the OpenAI API to provide AI-generated responses to users' messages. The bot is created using Node.js and Discord.js and responds when users type a message in a Discord channel that starts with the command "!chatgpt".

To use this program, you must provide your own Discord bot token and OpenAI API secret key in the .env file. To run the program, use the command "node index.js"; however, you will first need Node.js installed.
